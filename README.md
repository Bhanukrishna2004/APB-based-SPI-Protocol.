# APB-based-SPI-Protocol.
This project implements an APB-based SPI controller for efficient and configurable serial communication in SoC designs. It includes APB register control, support for CPOL/CPHA, variable data width, full-duplex transfers, and master/slave modes. A self-checking testbench with protocol checks and waveform validation ensures functional correctness.
