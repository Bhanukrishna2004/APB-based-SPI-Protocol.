# APB-based-SPI-Protocol.
This project focuses on designing and verifying an APB-based SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) controller that enables flexible and reliable serial communication inside an SoC. The SPI core supports features like configurable clock polarity and phase (CPOL/CPHA), programmable data width, and both master and slave operating modes, allowing it to work with a wide range of external devices. An APB slave interface is used to configure and control the SPI module through memory-mapped registers, handling address decoding, read/write operations, and status reporting. The SPI block performs serial data shifting, sampling, and clock generation to ensure accurate full-duplex communication. To validate the design, a complete SystemVerilog verification environment was created with a self-checking testbench, stimulus generation, protocol monitoring, and waveform analysis. This project helped strengthen practical understanding of bus interfacing, protocol implementation, RTL design, and verification methodologies.
